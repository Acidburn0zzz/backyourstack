Back Your Stack is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!

## Contributing ideas

If you want to help and are not sure where to start, we have some ideas!

### Supporting more dependency managers

Back Your Stack is currenly only detecting and supporting `npm` packages. For sure, we're aware Javascript is not the only progamming language in the world and will be happy to support popular platforms like RubyGems and PHP/Composer.

There are already tickets existing for:

- [PHP / Composer](https://github.com/opencollective/backyourstack/issues/28)
- [Python](https://github.com/opencollective/backyourstack/issues/34)

### Supporting more funding platforms

Back Your Stack was initiated by people at Open Collective but doesn't intend to be limited to projects registered on the Open Collective platform. If you know any other platform and have an idea on how to integrate it, please contribute!
